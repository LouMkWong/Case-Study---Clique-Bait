````sql
    SELECT 
    	COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as user_num
    FROM clique_bait.users;
````

| user_num |

    	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_time) as Month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) as Visit_count
    FROM clique_bait.events
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_time);
````

| month | visit_count |

### 4. What is the number of events for each event type?
````sql
    -- Joining event table with event identifier to get the corresponding event name
    -- group by event type, event name to get the total count of each event
   SELECT 
    	e.event_type,
        ei.event_name,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM clique_bait.events as e
    LEFT JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier as ei

| 4          | Ad Impression | 876   |
| 5          | Ad Click      | 702   |

### 5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
````sql
    SELECT
        	ROUND(
        	100
            *CAST((SELECT COUNT(event_type) FROM clique_bait.events where event_type = 3) as numeric)
            / COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id)
            , 2) AS percentage_purchase_per_visit
        FROM clique_bait.events;
````
| percentage_purchase_per_visit |
| ----------------------------- |
| 49.86                         |

### 6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?
````sql
    -- where page id 12 is the check out page, page id 13 is the confirmation page 
    ---and event type 3 is the event when customer make a purchase

    -- first calculate the percentage of how many people make a purchase after view the purchase page 
    -- then subtract 1 from it to get the percentage of customer who viewed the checkout page but didn't make a purchase
    SELECT 
    	100 - 
        ROUND(
        (100*CAST(COUNT(*) as numeric) / 
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clique_bait.events WHERE page_id = 12 GROUP BY page_id))
        , 2) as PCT_NO_PURCHASE
    FROM clique_bait.events
    WHERE page_id = 13 and event_type = 3
    GROUP BY page_id;
````
| pct_no_purchase |
| --------------- |
| 15.50           |

### 7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?
````sql
    SELECT 
    	ph.page_name,
        COUNT(*)
    FROM clique_bait.events AS e 
    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
    WHERE e.event_type = 1 
    GROUP BY ph.page_name
    ORDER BY 2 DESC
    LIMIT 10;
````
| page_name      | count |
| -------------- | ----- |
| All Products   | 3174  |
| Checkout       | 2103  |
| Home Page      | 1782  |
| Oyster         | 1568  |
| Crab           | 1564  |
| Russian Caviar | 1563  |
| Kingfish       | 1559  |
| Salmon         | 1559  |
| Lobster        | 1547  |
| Abalone        | 1525  |

> As shown above, the top 3 pages by number of view are "ALL PRODUCTS", "CHECKOUT", and "HOME PAGE".  However, the top 3 viewed PRODUCT page would be "Oyster", "Crab" and "Russian Caviar)

### 8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
````sql
    SELECT 
    	ph.product_category,
        SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as view_count, -- if event type is 1 (page viewed) then we assign a 1 and sum them together
        SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as added_to_cart_count, -- if event type is 2 (add to cart) then we assign a 1 and sum them together
        ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as numeric)/SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) as rate
    FROM clique_bait.events as e 
    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph on e.page_id = ph.page_id
    WHERE ph.product_category is NOT NULL
    GROUP BY ph.product_category
    ORDER BY 3 DESC;
````
| product_category | view_count | added_to_cart_count | rate |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ---- |
| Shellfish        | 6204       | 3792                | 0.61 |
| Fish             | 4633       | 2789                | 0.60 |
| Luxury           | 3032       | 1870                | 0.62 |

> Note that each view has a 60 percent chance that the product will get added to cart for all 3 category

### 9. What are the top 3 products by purchases? 
At first glance this should be a simple question but it gets complicated because of the way how the database is set up.
To find the top products purchased, we first have to find out the visit_ids that actually made a purchase (event_id = 3), we then find all the products that were added to cart for each of those visit_id.  At last, we count each product that were added to cart (that are also "purchased")
````sql
    -- find all the visitor_id that made a purchase
    WITH purchase as (
      SELECT
      	visit_id,
      	event_type
      FROM clique_bait.events
      WHERE event_type = 3)
    
    -- with the visitor_ids we got from our cte, we find out all the products that those visitor had add to cart
    SELECT
    	ph.page_name as Product_name,
        COUNT(e.page_id) as Purchase_made
    FROM clique_bait.events AS e
    JOIN purchase as p on e.visit_id = p.visit_id
    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph on e.page_id = ph.page_id
    WHERE e.event_type = 2 -- add to cart
    GROUP BY ph.page_name
    ORDER BY 2 DESC;
````
| product_name   | purchase_made |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Lobster        | 754           |
| Oyster         | 726           |
| Crab           | 719           |
| Salmon         | 711           |
| Kingfish       | 707           |
| Black Truffle  | 707           |
| Abalone        | 699           |
| Russian Caviar | 697           |
| Tuna           | 697           |

> Top 3 products purchased would be "Lobster", "Oyster" and "Crab".  Interesting that although Russian caviar has the third highest view counts among all products but it is the second least sold product.  Salmon and kingfish also has higher view counts than lobster but are sold less then lobster by a small margin.

## B. Product Funnel Analysis
Creating a table that shows the following: 
- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product purchased?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?

We can do this by turning some of our sql scripts above into a CTE then join them together and add a calculated column for "abandoned".
````sql
    WITH cart1 as (
    SELECT 
       	ph.page_name as Product_name,
        COUNT(*) as added_to_cart
    FROM clique_bait.events AS e 
    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
    WHERE e.event_type = 2 
    GROUP BY ph.page_name),
    
    view1 as (
    SELECT 
       	ph.page_name as Product_name,
        COUNT(*) as view_count
    FROM clique_bait.events AS e 
    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
    WHERE e.event_type = 1 
    GROUP BY ph.page_name),
    
    purchased1 as (    
      WITH purchase as (
          SELECT
          	visit_id,
          	event_type
          FROM clique_bait.events
          WHERE event_type = 3)
    
        SELECT
        	ph.page_name as Product_name,
      		ph.product_category as category,
            COUNT(e.page_id) as Purchase_made
        FROM clique_bait.events AS e
        JOIN purchase as p on e.visit_id = p.visit_id
        JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy as ph on e.page_id = ph.page_id
        WHERE e.event_type = 2 
        GROUP BY ph.page_name, ph.product_category)
        
    SELECT 
    	c.Product_name,
        p.category,
        v.view_count,
        c.added_to_cart,
        p.Purchase_made,
        c.added_to_cart - p.Purchase_made as abandoned,
        ROUND(100*CAST(p.Purchase_made as numeric)/v.view_count, 2) as view_to_purchase_pct,
        ROUND(100*CAST(c.added_to_cart as numeric)/v.view_count, 2) as view_to_cart_add_pct,
        ROUND(100*CAST(p.Purchase_made as numeric)/c.added_to_cart, 2) as cart_add_to_purchase_pct
    FROM cart1 as c 
    JOIN view1 as v on c.Product_name = v.Product_name
    JOIN purchased1 as p on v.Product_name = p.Product_name
    ORDER BY 2, 3 DESC;

| Most added to cart | Lobster | 968 |
| Most purchased | Lobster | 754 |

| Highest view to purchase percentage | Lobster | 48.78% |
| Average conversion rate from view to cart add | --- | 60.95% |
